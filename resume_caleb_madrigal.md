# Caleb Madrigal

I help pull the signal out of the noise. With Machine Learning, there's a lot of noise - noisy data (which needs to be cleaned and transformed), noisy processes (e.g. what model version is running in production? What data was that model trained on?). I can help add structure to such environments (such as via ML Pipelines). I also love math, and can help develop both Machine Learning Models as well as other sorts of computational models.
