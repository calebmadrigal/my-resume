<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>I like programming, hacking, and mathing! Since high school, I've been into network programming, cryptography, and security stuff, and I consider that my forte. In my free time, you'll often find me playing with things like Software-Defined Radio, making or hacking IoT devices, or doing with mathy things. On the math-side of stuff, I'm most interested in using math to see things that are otherwise difficult - pulling the signal out of the noise.</p>
<p>Though I've had experience with fluffy languages like Javascript and .NET (don't count that against me! It's a symptom of living in the midwest!), I can write some tight C code, though if I have my druthers, I usually write it in Python.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I try to be humble and kind to everyone. I think I'm a pretty likable person (or else, I just can't read people at all :) ).</p>

<h5 id="client-wisconsin-lawyers-mutual-insurance-company-2013-2015">Client: Wisconsin Lawyers Mutual Insurance Company, 2013-2015</h5>
<ul>
<li><em>Technologies:</em> Node.js, Express.js, AngularJS, MongoDB, Java, SOAP, Oracle, Linux</li>
<li>Lead a small team to create a web portal for a legacy enterprise Java policy administration system. This allows clients to pay premiums and renew their policies via the web (previously a paper transaction).</li>
<li>The front-end was implemented as a Single-Page App (with AngularJS, and Bootstrap).</li>
<li>Backing the front-end was a &quot;smart proxy&quot; (written in Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB) which presented the front-end with a nice RESTful API, and which abstracted away the dirty details of making all kinds of complex SOAP calls to the legacy Java system.</li>
<li>I built the smart proxy into the design not only to make the front-end simpler, but also because the client was considering moving away from their legacy Java policy administration system, and the smart proxy would allow them to more easily replace it with minimal impact to the web portal codebase.</li>
<li>Wrote integration tests in Python which validated that the legacy Java service layer was behaving as expected.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="client-hewins-financial-2013-2015">Client: Hewins Financial, 2013-2015</h5>
<ul>
<li><em>Technologies:</em> Java EE, Google Web Toolkit, MySQL, Linux, Python, ZeroMQ</li>
<li>Created a web app which enables financial advisors to rapidly model their clients' financial outlook and walk them through various financial scenarios.</li>
<li>Created an offline version of the app by wrapping the server software in a Virtual Machine.</li>
<li>For the offline version of the app, I wrote a protection layer in Python (web app and daemon) which required users to log in, and periodically would check with the server that they still are authorized to use the app. If a user was no longer authorized (or the protection layer was unable to contact the validation server in a given time period), then the protection layer would disable the app. This protection layer used ZeroMQ to communicate between its subprocesses.</li>
